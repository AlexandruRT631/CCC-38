# Cloudflight Coding Contest 38
This repository contains my solution to the 38th edition of the Cloudflight Coding Contest. The solutions are for the Classic contest.
Out of the 8 problems, I have solved 5 and started solving the 6th before time run out. The repository contains .pdf files with the levels as well as .zip files with the inputs.
The archives only need to be unzipped in the root directory, and the program will automatically create the outputs based on them and based on which level is ran.
